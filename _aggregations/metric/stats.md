# Stats aggregations

The `stats` aggregation is a multi-value metric aggregation that computes a summary of numeric data. This aggregation is useful for quick understanding of the distribution of a numeric fields. It can operate [directly on a field](#computing-stats-on-electricity-usage), apply a [script to derive the values](#using-a-script-to-compute-derived-values), or [handle documents with missing fields](#handling-documents-with-missing-fields). The `stats` aggregation returns five values:

* `count`: The number of values collected
* `min`: The lowest value
* `max`: The highest value
* `sum`: The total of all values
* `avg`: The average of the values (sum divided by count)


## Example

The following example computes `stats` aggregation on electricity usage.

### Computing stats on electricity usage

Create an index named `power_usage` and add documents where each document contains the number of kilowatt-hours (kWh) consumed during a given hour using the following request:

```json
PUT /power_usage/_bulk?refresh=true
{"index": {}}
{"device_id": "A1", "kwh": 1.2}
{"index": {}}
{"device_id": "A2", "kwh": 0.7}
{"index": {}}
{"device_id": "A3", "kwh": 1.5}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

To compute statistics on the `kwh` field across all documents, use the following aggregation request which suppresses document hits by setting `size` to `0`, and defines a `stats` aggregation named `consumption_stats` over the `kwh` field:

```json
GET /power_usage/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "consumption_stats": {
      "stats": {
        "field": "kwh"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response includes `count`, `min`, `max`, `avg`, and `sum` for the three values ingested:

```json
{
  ...
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 3,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": null,
    "hits": []
  },
  "aggregations": {
    "consumption_stats": {
      "count": 3,
      "min": 0.699999988079071,
      "max": 1.5,
      "avg": 1.1333333452542622,
      "sum": 3.400000035762787
    }
  }
}
```

### Running stats aggregation per bucket

You can compute separate statistics for each device by nesting a stats aggregation inside a terms aggregation on the device_id field. The terms aggregation groups documents into buckets based on unique device_id values, and the stats aggregation computes summary statistics within each bucket. See following example:

```json
GET /power_usage/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "per_device": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "device_id.keyword"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "device_usage_stats": {
          "stats": {
            "field": "kwh"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response returns one bucket per `device_id` with computed `count`, `min`, `max`, `avg`, and `sum` fields within each bucket:

```json
{
  ...
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 3,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": null,
    "hits": []
  },
  "aggregations": {
    "per_device": {
      "doc_count_error_upper_bound": 0,
      "sum_other_doc_count": 0,
      "buckets": [
        {
          "key": "A1",
          "doc_count": 1,
          "device_usage_stats": {
            "count": 1,
            "min": 1.2000000476837158,
            "max": 1.2000000476837158,
            "avg": 1.2000000476837158,
            "sum": 1.2000000476837158
          }
        },
        {
          "key": "A2",
          "doc_count": 1,
          "device_usage_stats": {
            "count": 1,
            "min": 0.699999988079071,
            "max": 0.699999988079071,
            "avg": 0.699999988079071,
            "sum": 0.699999988079071
          }
        },
        {
          "key": "A3",
          "doc_count": 1,
          "device_usage_stats": {
            "count": 1,
            "min": 1.5,
            "max": 1.5,
            "avg": 1.5,
            "sum": 1.5
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This allows you to compare usage statistics across devices in a single query.

### Using a script to compute derived values

You can also use a script to compute the values used in the `stats` aggregation. This is useful when the metric is derived from document fields or requires transformation.

For example, if you want to convert kilowatt-hours to watt-hours before computing `stats` aggregation. Since `1 kWh` = `1000 Wh`, the can use the following request which utilizes a script to multiply the values by 1000. This aggregation uses the result of `doc['kwh'].value * 1000` as the input value for each document:

```json
GET /power_usage/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "usage_wh_stats": {
      "stats": {
        "script": {
          "source": "doc['kwh'].value * 1000"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The `stats` aggregation returned in the response reflect values of `1200`, `700`, and `1500` watt-hours:

```json
{
  ...
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 3,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": null,
    "hits": []
  },
  "aggregations": {
    "usage_wh_stats": {
      "count": 3,
      "min": 699.999988079071,
      "max": 1500,
      "avg": 1133.3333452542622,
      "sum": 3400.000035762787
    }
  }
}
```

### Using a value script with a field

When combining a field with a transformation, you can specify both `field` and `script`. This allows using the `_value` variable to reference the fieldâ€™s value within the script.

The following example increases each energy reading by 5% before computing `stats` aggregation:

```json
GET /power_usage/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "adjusted_usage": {
      "stats": {
        "field": "kwh",
        "script": {
          "source": "_value * 1.05"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

### Handling documents with missing fields

If some documents do not contain the target field, they are excluded by default from the aggregation. To include them using a default value, you can specify the `missing` parameter.

The following request treats missing `kwh` values as `0.0`:

```json
GET /power_usage/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "consumption_with_default": {
      "stats": {
        "field": "kwh",
        "missing": 0.0
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}
